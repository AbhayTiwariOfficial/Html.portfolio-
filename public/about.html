<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Abhay, currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Applications (BCA).
  I'm a self-starter with a passion for learning and building things from the ground up.<br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  My interests lie in web development, where I actively work on various projects that help enhance my skills and broaden my understanding of modern technologies.<br/>
 </p>

<p>
  I'm particularly driven by the challenge of solving problems through code, and I enjoy creating functional, user-friendly web applications.<br/>
  Whether it's backend logic, user interfaces, or database management, I thrive on making things work seamlessly.
